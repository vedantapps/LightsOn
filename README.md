- Interactive and immersive story puts the user as the Deputy Manager.
- A story that demonstrates how quick action, smart thinking, and teamwork can help resolve issues and drive solutions even in stressful/critical times.
- 7 total experiences (Messages, Power, Refine, Mapping, Countdown, Info, and Settings).
- Refine numbers with Hand Tracking. Simply hover your hand close to the number that needs to be refined.
